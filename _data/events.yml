      The 2020 Census is just around the corner, and yet so many fraught issues remain unresolved.
      Join us on April 24 to hear from library professionals throughout the state as they make preparations for the 2020 census. The challenges for libraries are manifold: this coming census is the first to move to a digital collection method, and the U.S. government is moving to collect data on citizenship. In spite of these barriers, a fair and accurate count is required to ensure representation and allocation of funds from the federal government.
      We’ll learn how libraries across the state are preparing for an influx of census-related inquiries from their communities. We’ll discuss the implications of the move to a digital census. What tools and tactics are needed to ensure a quality count while protecting the privacy of our patrons? How can we work together to ensure that libraries are provided with all the resources they need to operationalize the census at scale?
      Panelists include:



      Caroline Ashby (Nassau Library System)


      Greta Byrum, moderator (Digital Equity Laboratory at The New School)

      MaryLou Carolan (Newburgh Free Library)

      Anita Favretto (The New York Public Library)


      Tara Lannen-Stanton (Queens Library)


      Lauren Moore (Pioneer Library System)


      Jesse Montero (Brooklyn Public Library)


      Grace Riario (Ramapo Catskill Library System)



      Fees for this event are $10, which will go toward funding travel for our speakers. In the event that these fees present a hardship, please reach out to deanderson@metro.org.
      This event will be livestreamed; a link will be sent to those who register.

      It's the year 2039. Where's your podcast? (A Preserve This Podcast workshop)
      Bring your hard drives. Bring your laptops. Bring your Dropbox password. We’re going to preserve your podcast. Zines will be provided.
      If you’ve listened to our podcast or read our zine, you know that podcasts are disappearing. So how can podcasters protect themselves against loss? By attending our first ever Preserve This Podcast workshop. This interactive workshop will tackle this issue head-on by walking audio-creators through the history of podcast technology, the basics of archival preservation, and simple steps you can take to preserve your audio. We will review through the tools and techniques to prevent data loss before it’s too late, as well as “bake” these concepts into podcasters’ existing production workflows.

      About our instructors:


      Dana Gerber-Margie (@theaudiosignal) listens to podcasts while living in Madison, Wisconsin. She earned her Master's in Library & Information Studies at UW-Madison, and has worked as an A/V Archivist for WiLS and the Wisconsin Historical Society. She is the co-founder and co-editor of the Bello Collective, a publication about podcasts and storytelling.
      Mary Kidd (@kiddarchivist) is an archivist and illustrator. By day, she works for New York Public Library's Preservation and Collections Processing Department. She has worked on audio/visual preservation projects for New York Public Radio, and the XFR Collective, a non-profit organization that transfers at-risk media off magnetic tapes to digital format for individuals and groups with limited means. She creates drawings, zines, gifs, and other artful tidbits to make preservation and archiving, and the technology that supports it, accessible, approachable for all.



      Sarah Nguyen (@snewyuen) is the Assistant Producer and Project Coordinator of Preserve This Podcast. She is an advocate for open, accessible, and secure technologies through a few gigs during studies as a Master’s of Library and Information Science candidate at the University of Washington iSchool: Instructional Design Technologist at CUNY City Tech Open Education Resources Program and as a Git Research Assistant for NYU Libraries. Offline, she can be found riding a Cannondale mtb or practicing movement through dance.

  description:
    text: |-
      ArchivesSpace is an open source application for managing and providing web access to archives, manuscripts, and digital objects. This one-day workshop will introduce the ArchivesSpace archives information management system and provide training in performing many basic functions in the application. Through instruction and discussion, participants will learn how to use ArchivesSpace to manage accession, resource (collection), digital object, and authority records, as well as some ways to import data into and export data out of the application. Participants will have access to the application and can follow along with the instructor in hands on exercises.
      This workshop is particularly appropriate for those who are new to ArchivesSpace or just getting started. It is geared toward professional archivists and others working with collection materials and assumes an understanding of archival concepts and functions. The workshop does not address installing or maintaining the software or advanced concepts such as data migration or customizing the application interface.
      Upon completing this full-day workshop, attendees will have been introduced to using ArchivesSpace to:


      Create Accession records


      Create Resource records


      Create Digital Object records


      Create and manage Agent and Subject records, and link them to Accession, Resource, and Digital Object records


      Record and manage physical locations within a repository


      Produce description output files in standardized data structures such as EAD and MARCXML


      Import legacy data



      What to bring:


      A laptop 



      Or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00




      Instructor:
      Mark Custer is an Archivist / Metadata Coordinator at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Mark has served on the ArchivesSpace Users Advisory, helped oversee the redevelopment of the ArchivesSpace Public User Interface, and helped launch the Archives at Yale discovery platform at Yale University which uses ArchivesSpace.  Previously, he worked at the Smithsonian Institution, at East Carolina University, and at the Granville County Public Library in North Carolina.

  description:
    text: |-
      The way we use media is not just something to be concerned about in school. It has real world applications and life-long impact.
      Our workshop will help prticipants understand the importance of media literacy, and the librarian's role in educating their students. We will focus on the prevalence of fake news and its impact on learning, as well as in life. We won't just look at fake news, but how the media landscape is changing, and how to best prepare our students to use information effectively.
      Alia Methven and Cherie Yanek from Avenues: The World School will explore this timely topic in an interactive workshop. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of fake news and programming ideas to apply to school and public environments.
      What to bring:


      A laptop (click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00)


      About our instructors:
      Cherie Yanek is an Upper Division Librarian at Avenues: The World School, where she teaches research skills and media literacy to grades 5-12, and promotes reading and love of literature as much as she can. She has worked in public, nonprofit, corporate, and academic libraries. She has an MLS from Queens College and an MFA from Naropa University.
      Alia Methven is the Director of Library Media Services at Avenues: The World School. She is a NYS certified teacher and library media specialist, and has worked in both public and private schools for over 17 years. Providing a dynamic and collaborative school library program that supports 21st century learning and literacy has never been more timely nor important given the increasingly digital and information-driven world in which we live.

      <P><SPAN>Our workshop will help prticipants understand the importance of media literacy, and the librarian's role in educating their students. We will focus on the prevalence of fake news and its impact on learning, as well as in life. We won't just look at fake news, but how the media landscape is changing, and how to best prepare our students to use information effectively.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN>Alia Methven and Cherie Yanek from Avenues: The World School will explore this timely topic in an interactive workshop. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of fake news and programming ideas to apply to school and public environments.</SPAN></P>

      about what is going on in the country today, Americans are also more hopeful
      about solving problems. This hopefulness may account for the increased interest
