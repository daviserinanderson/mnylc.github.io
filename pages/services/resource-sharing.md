METRO has developed and maintains resource sharing services among our member libraries. Our resource sharing services open the world of knowledge to patrons of our member libraries by providing access to collections around New York City and Westchester County.

We facilitate resource sharing through our Referral Card Program and our Delivery Program. Read on for more.

## Referral Cards
The METRO Referral Card system makes it easier for students and researchers to locate materials or research onsite at METRO member libraries.

### Overview
Yellow Cards allow patrons to search for a specific book or any other item at a METRO member library. Blue cards allow users to search across entire subject areas at METRO member libraries. Both METRO cards are available at [participating member libraries.]({{ "https://metro.org/members/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) Please contact Mark Parson at [mparson@metro.org](mailto:mparson@metro.org), or (212) 228-2320 ext 7121 for more information.  

### How to Use Yellow Cards
The Yellow Card gives library users access to individual titles from other METRO member libraries. 

To participate in this program, library users must:


  1. Verify that the desired title is not available in your library or in the public library system
  2. Identify a library that has the title available using OCLC, WorldCat, Docline, or related resources
  3. Check the library's listing in the [METRO Member Directory]({{ "https://metro.org/members/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
  (Remember: access restrictions may apply)
  4. Call or email the holding library to verify that the title is available and to confirm any access restrictions
  5. Fill out the card completely, including the source of verification


The host library must determine the period during which a patron may have access to the item.
Yellow Cards do not give users unlimited access to another library's collections and does not guarantee that materials will be available at a given time. In most cases, access is limited to the specific item indicated on the Yellow Card.

Instructions to the Host Library: Before facilitating access to a title for a patron through the Yellow Card Program, a contact at the host library should confirm the card information and collect the card from the user. The host library should submit all cards received to METRO at the end of each month.
 
### How to Use Blue Cards
Blue Cards provide patrons with access to collections at participating host libraries. To access this program, users must:

1. Verify that a host library has a strong collection in your subject area
2. Confirm in the [METRO Member Directory]({{ "https://metro.org/members/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) that the library is a
Blue Card program participant
3. Contact the host library to confirm any restrictions on access to collections
4. The host library determines the length of time that a user may have access to a collection.

Blue Cards do not give users unlimited access to another library's collections and does not guarantee that materials will be available at a given time. In most cases, access is limited to materials indicated on the Blue Card.

Instructions to the Host Library: Before facilitating access to a title for a patron through the Blue Card Program, a contact at the host library should confirm the card information and collect the card from the user. The host library should submit all cards received to METRO at the end of each month.
 
## Delivery Service
METRO maintains next-day, Mon-Fri delivery service among our member libraries. Delivery service ensures that our members can count on
efficient access to items from collections throughout METRO's service area. METRO Delivery is a free membership benefit with the
following restrictions:

Each library must designate a delivery site and a contact person. Additional delivery sites may be arranged at additional cost. There are additional fees for packages over 25 pounds. 

### Site Locations 
Libraries should designate a single on-site location for pick-up and delivery. This location should be staffed to provide signatures for
incoming deliveries and oversee outgoing packages.

### Shipping & Packaging Requirements
A wide variety of materials including books, journals, magazines, copies, CDs, DVDs, or any type of bound material may be shipped through the service. You may not ship equipment or furniture. 

All items must be appropriately wrapped and sealed in tearproof envelopes, sturdy bags, or boxes. The first 25 pounds of each shipment are free. Over 25 pounds, additional weight charges will apply.

### Sending Items
Check the delivery column of our [Member Directory]({{ "https://metro.org/members/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) before shipping. This way you can verify that a receiving institution is a current participant in METROâ€™s Delivery Service.

### Receiver requirements
A representative of the receiving library must sign for all shipments at the time of delivery. Couriers are unable to leave a package without a receipt signature. 

### Contact Information
To get set up with our Delivery Program or to report any issues, please contact Mark Parson at [mparson@metro.org](mailto:mparson@metro.org), or (212) 228-2320 ext 7121.
