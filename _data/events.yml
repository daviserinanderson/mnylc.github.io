    html: Introduction to Python and ArchivesSnake for Archivists
  description:
    text: |-
      Ever need to make mass changes to your archival description? Need a list of accessions for the last year? Python is a powerful way to read and manipulate your ArchivesSpace data at scale, and ArchivesSnake manages the API calls for you, so you can read, sort, and edit your titles, dates, and notes with only a few lines of code. This workshop introduces archivists to the basics of Python and teaches them how to write basic scripts to work with the ArchivesSpace API.
      This workshop is designed for archivists who have experience working with archival description, and want to learn how to work with data at scale, and explore Python as a tool to streamline or automate their workflows. Attendees will lean how to create and run Python scripts on their local computer and the basics of Python syntax. After that, they will dive right in and edit or write some code to query, reformat, and edit archival data with an ArchivesSpace instance that will be provided.
      You might not become a Python pro in one afternoon, but this workshop will give you a foundation and some basic skills and examples that will later help you explore on your own. Come dive in and learn what is possible with Python and ArchivesSpace!
      After completing this workshop, attendees will know how to:


      Create and run Python scripts


      Install packages with PIP


      Understand data types


      Use basic Python syntax, including


      If/else conditionals


      For loops


      Variables


      Understand the ArchivesSpace API


      Install and configure ArchivesSnake


      Query and edit data using the ArchivesSpace API





      Requirements:


      A laptop with the ability to install local software.


      Some comfort with the command line is helpful, but only a willingness to learn is required.


      Prior understanding of archival description and/or ArchivesSpace data will be helpful, but experience with ArchivesSpace is not required.

      about what is going on in the country today, Americans are also more hopeful
      about solving problems. This hopefulness may account for the increased interest

      It’s a familiar story.
      Institution identifies a need. Institution applies for grant funding. Institution receives funding (or fronts the money themselves), onboards staff, works for months toward a viable outcome. Funding ends. The project sunsets, and workers find themselves on the job market once more.
      While many initiatives find their footing, this cycle is all too real in the library, archives, and museum industry. Much-heralded project outputs fall into the rear view. New services end. Workers find themselves in an increasingly contingent labor market.
      Please join us for a daylong symposium hosted by METRO Library Council (599 11th Avenue, 8th Floor) on Friday, June 14. We’ll gather to share the stories of projects that got their start with temporary sources of money, hear from grant-makers who are witness to our growing financial needs, and consider potential paths forward.

      <P>Institution identifies a need. Institution applies for grant funding. Institution receives funding (or fronts the money themselves), onboards staff, works for months toward a viable outcome. Funding ends. The project sunsets, and workers find themselves on the job market once more.</P>
      <P>While many initiatives find their footing, this cycle is all too real in the library, archives, and museum industry. Much-heralded project outputs fall into the rear view. New services end. Workers find themselves in an increasingly contingent labor market.</P>
      <P>Please join us for a daylong symposium hosted by METRO Library Council (599 11th Avenue, 8th Floor) on Friday, June 14. We’ll gather to share the stories of projects that got their start with temporary sources of money, hear from grant-makers who are witness to our growing financial needs, and consider potential paths forward.</P>

      Archives Connect: Developing an Educational Outreach Initiative for Your Archive

      Archives and special collections are poised to play a more significant and instrumental role in student achievement since the implementation of the Common Core standards. With a particular emphasis on 21st Century learning skills, including the ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with peers to create high quality, scholarly work, these standards present an opportunity for archives to share their expertise with all educators and learners.
      This workshop models how participants can implement school outreach initiatives using the special collections and archives at their institutions, including how to utilize archival collections to meet Common Core Standards, create lesson plans, and engage students and teachers in history research to support a variety of academic disciplines.
      This workshop is for anyone who is interested in creating a program at their library or archive; no prior work in educational programming is required. 
      Registration includes a 120-page workshop booklet. 

      What to bring:


      Notetaking materials
