      It’s a familiar story.
      Institution identifies a need. Institution applies for grant funding. Institution receives funding (or fronts the money themselves), onboards staff, works for months toward a viable outcome. Funding ends. The project sunsets, and workers find themselves on the job market once more.
      While many initiatives find their footing, this cycle is all too real in the library, archives, and museum industry. Much-heralded project outputs fall into the rear view. New services end. Workers find themselves in an increasingly contingent labor market.
      Please join us for a daylong symposium hosted by METRO Library Council (599 11th Avenue, 8th Floor) on Friday, June 14. We’ll gather to share the stories of projects that got their start with temporary sources of money, hear from grant-makers who are witness to our growing financial needs, and consider potential paths forward.

      c4l NYC Meetup. Discuss your current projects and be inspired to start new ones.</p>
      <p>METRO will provide coffee and cookies--feel free to bring a snack to share.
      If there is interest, we can move to Gotham West Market after the event ends.</p>
      <p>This meetup is for everyone! From the code4lib "about us": "code4lib isn’t
      entirely about code or libraries. It is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers,
      designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around
      the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on
      technology ''stuff.''"</p> '
