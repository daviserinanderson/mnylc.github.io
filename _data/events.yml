      c4l NYC Meetup. Discuss your current projects and be inspired to start new ones.</p>
      <p>METRO will provide coffee and cookies--feel free to bring a snack to share.
      If there is interest, we can move to Gotham West Market after the event ends.</p>
      <p>This meetup is for everyone! From the code4lib "about us": "code4lib isnâ€™t
      entirely about code or libraries. It is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers,
      designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around
      the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on
      technology ''stuff.''"</p> '
