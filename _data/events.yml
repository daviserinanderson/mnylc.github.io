      <p>This meetup is for everyone! From the code4lib "about us": "code4lib isn’t
      entirely about code or libraries. It is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers,
      designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around
      the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on
      technology ''stuff.''"</p> '

      in LIS Meetup.</p> <p>Let’s discuss professionalism in librarianship, our definitions
      for professionalism and the ways we sustain neutrality when performing it. We

      and why. In addition, we will be discussing how oppressive professionalism is

    html: 'The Future Is Open Access, but How Do We Get There?: A Symposium'
  description:
    text: |-
      Each year, more and more scholarly works are made openly available. Indeed, with European research agencies now coordinating to require immediate open access to publications based on research they fund, predictions about the inevitability of open access may soon come true. 
      As open access becomes the norm, what decisions will scholars, libraries, and institutions make? Will we reproduce existing power structures, guaranteeing the continued dominance of high-profit publishers and flawed impact metrics? Or will we build something different — community-led publishing on community-owned infrastructure, with legal terms that protect the rights and privacy of authors and readers?
      We will explore these questions in a symposium hosted by METRO Library Council on Thursday, September 12. This event is planned in collaboration with colleagues from the City University of New York.
      We are now accepting proposals for presentations, panels, activities, and facilitated discussions relevant to these questions. Possible topics include but are not limited to:

      Scholarly start-ups, business models, and acquisitions 
      Library publishing services
      Tensions between readership data and privacy
      Investing in open publishing and/or open infrastructure
      Use and misuse of metrics in faculty evaluation
      Open advocacy inside and outside the library

      To submit a proposal, please complete this form by Thursday, August 1. We look forward to hearing from you!

      Reflect on how texts have shaped their personal identity and how it can shape those of students and patrons
      Develop an understanding of why and how to think critically about text choices
      Brainstorm strategies for bringing these practices into their local contexts and workplaces

      Data, Data, Everywhere: Why Tech Giants Collect Your Data and How To Stop Them
      Many of us use digital technology nearly every waking hour of our day. And we’re not alone: studies show that the typical American adult looks at screens for an average of eleven hours a day…. and counting.
      The eleven hours spent with our devices produce a steady stream of personal data that can be utilized by tech giants to influence our behavior. More pressingly, our accumulated data can be used against us in the event of, for example, a successful phishing attempt or a data breach.
      This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to how the internet works so that we can identify how and why our information is collected, with and without our knowledge. We’ll take a tour of the online information flow, discuss the ways in which our information is used, and describe how even our smallest actions -- like which posts we stop to read and which links we click -- amount to data so valuable that internet companies will do almost anything to keep our attention.
      We’ll describe the ways in which we can reduce the impact of all of this exposure. And since this goes beyond us as individuals, we will discuss the ways in which our patrons are exposed to these same issues. We’ll develop creative solutions for what we can do to help.
      By the end of this workshop, you’ll have a better sense of the data that’s being collected about you, why it is being collected, and what we can do to protect ourselves and our patrons from relentless surveillance.
      About the facilitatorDavis Erin Anderson's work focuses on understanding the impact of technology on culture at large, translating these challenges into real solutions for library staff. She is project lead for NYC Digital Safety, an NYC-funded program that keeps library staff informed about evergreen topics in data privacy and digital security.
      Davis worked with Mozilla Foundation to review and update their web literacy curriculum, resulting in the launch of Mozilla’s Core Curriculum for Web Literacy in March 2018. In addition to planning and emceeing METRO’s symposia series, Davis has designed and facilitated workshops on data privacy & security, web mechanics, and personal networking skills for library staff.
