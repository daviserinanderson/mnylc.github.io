      previous 4 sessions this year, in this session folks will bring things that
      they are actively working or struggling on and share their preservation techniques
      and or ask for assistance from others attendees. For example, I want to learn
      how you run checksums and report on them.</p> <p>Note:<br/>For this to be valuable,
      let's hope for a large number of registrants.<br/>Also, please bring your laptop
      loaded with some assets, metadata and tools.</p> <p>Finally, please thank Davis
      @ Metro for facilitating space and scheduling. Without Davis and Metro, these
      opportunities would not be possible.</p> "

      It’s a familiar story.
      Institution identifies a need. Institution applies for grant funding. Institution receives funding (or fronts the money themselves), onboards staff, works for months toward a viable outcome. Funding ends. The project sunsets, and workers find themselves on the job market once more.
      While many initiatives find their footing, this cycle is all too real in the library, archives, and museum industry. Much-heralded project outputs fall into the rear view. New services end. Workers find themselves in an increasingly contingent labor market.
      Please join us for a daylong symposium hosted by METRO Library Council (599 11th Avenue, 8th Floor) on Friday, June 14. We’ll gather to share the stories of projects that got their start with temporary sources of money, hear from grant-makers who are witness to our growing financial needs, and consider potential paths forward.
