      <p>This meetup is for everyone! From the code4lib "about us": "code4lib isnâ€™t
      entirely about code or libraries. It is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers,
      designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around
      the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on
      technology ''stuff.''"</p> '
