    text: |
      Every April, the U.S. celebrates National Library Week. Podcast Brunch Club is steadily adding more library partners to its list of chapters. In honor of both of these things, we wanted to put together a listening list that pays tribute to libraries all over the world. Libraries of today are so much more than books; they circulate all kinds of things from hotspots and e-readers to instruments and kitchen appliances. Libraries themselves are also more than just buildings–these spaces function as community centers: offering meeting spaces, assistance with social services, and access to technology. This listening list explores how libraries have evolved from their origins as places that house information and knowledge to the institutions of today that work to positively impact the communities around them.


      (This listening list was curated by Emily Johnson and Dani Elizabeth, who are the chapter leaders of PBC’s first-ever library partner, Meridian Library District chapter.)




      We wish to provide a welcoming environment to visitors of all abilities. Please let us know if you require ability assistance by contacting events@metro.org in advance of this event.

      It's the year 2039. Where's your podcast? (A Preserve This Podcast workshop)
      Bring your hard drives. Bring your laptops. Bring your Dropbox password. We’re going to preserve your podcast. Zines will be provided.
      If you’ve listened to our podcast or read our zine, you know that podcasts are disappearing. So how can podcasters protect themselves against loss? By attending our first ever Preserve This Podcast workshop. This interactive workshop will tackle this issue head-on by walking audio-creators through the history of podcast technology, the basics of archival preservation, and simple steps you can take to preserve your audio. We will review through the tools and techniques to prevent data loss before it’s too late, as well as “bake” these concepts into podcasters’ existing production workflows.

      About our instructors:


      Dana Gerber-Margie (@theaudiosignal) listens to podcasts while living in Madison, Wisconsin. She earned her Master's in Library & Information Studies at UW-Madison, and has worked as an A/V Archivist for WiLS and the Wisconsin Historical Society. She is the co-founder and co-editor of the Bello Collective, a publication about podcasts and storytelling.
      Mary Kidd (@kiddarchivist) is an archivist and illustrator. By day, she works for New York Public Library's Preservation and Collections Processing Department. She has worked on audio/visual preservation projects for New York Public Radio, and the XFR Collective, a non-profit organization that transfers at-risk media off magnetic tapes to digital format for individuals and groups with limited means. She creates drawings, zines, gifs, and other artful tidbits to make preservation and archiving, and the technology that supports it, accessible, approachable for all.



      Sarah Nguyen (@snewyuen) is the Assistant Producer and Project Coordinator of Preserve This Podcast. She is an advocate for open, accessible, and secure technologies through a few gigs during studies as a Master’s of Library and Information Science candidate at the University of Washington iSchool: Instructional Design Technologist at CUNY City Tech Open Education Resources Program and as a Git Research Assistant for NYU Libraries. Offline, she can be found riding a Cannondale mtb or practicing movement through dance.

    html: Introduction to ArchivesSpace
  description:
    text: |-
      ArchivesSpace is an open source application for managing and providing web access to archives, manuscripts, and digital objects. This one-day workshop will introduce the ArchivesSpace archives information management system and provide training in performing many basic functions in the application. Through instruction and discussion, participants will learn how to use ArchivesSpace to manage accession, resource (collection), digital object, and authority records, as well as some ways to import data into and export data out of the application. Participants will have access to the application and can follow along with the instructor in hands on exercises.
      This workshop is particularly appropriate for those who are new to ArchivesSpace or just getting started. It is geared toward professional archivists and others working with collection materials and assumes an understanding of archival concepts and functions. The workshop does not address installing or maintaining the software or advanced concepts such as data migration or customizing the application interface.
      Upon completing this full-day workshop, attendees will have been introduced to using ArchivesSpace to:


      Create Accession records


      Create Resource records


      Create Digital Object records


      Create and manage Agent and Subject records, and link them to Accession, Resource, and Digital Object records


      Record and manage physical locations within a repository


      Produce description output files in standardized data structures such as EAD and MARCXML


      Import legacy data



      What to bring:


      A laptop 



      Or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00




      Instructor:
      Mark Custer is an Archivist / Metadata Coordinator at the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library. Mark has served on the ArchivesSpace Users Advisory, helped oversee the redevelopment of the ArchivesSpace Public User Interface, and helped launch the Archives at Yale discovery platform at Yale University which uses ArchivesSpace.  Previously, he worked at the Smithsonian Institution, at East Carolina University, and at the Granville County Public Library in North Carolina.


      We wish to provide a welcoming environment to visitors of all abilities. Please let us know if you require ability assistance by contacting events@metro.org in advance of this event.

    text: |-
      The way we use media is not just something to be concerned about in school. It has real world applications and life-long impact.
      Our workshop will help prticipants understand the importance of media literacy, and the librarian's role in educating their students. We will focus on the prevalence of fake news and its impact on learning, as well as in life. We won't just look at fake news, but how the media landscape is changing, and how to best prepare our students to use information effectively.
      Alia Methven and Cherie Yanek from Avenues: The World School will explore this timely topic in an interactive workshop. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of fake news and programming ideas to apply to school and public environments.
      What to bring:


      A laptop (click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00)


      About our instructors:

      <P><SPAN>The way we use media is not just something to be concerned about in school. It has real world applications and life-long impact.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN>Our workshop will help prticipants understand the importance of media literacy, and the librarian's role in educating their students. We will focus on the prevalence of fake news and its impact on learning, as well as in life. We won't just look at fake news, but how the media landscape is changing, and how to best prepare our students to use information effectively.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN>Alia Methven and Cherie Yanek from Avenues: The World School will explore this timely topic in an interactive workshop. Attendees will leave with a deeper understanding of fake news and programming ideas to apply to school and public environments.</SPAN></P>

    html: Introduction to Python and ArchivesSnake for Archivists
  description:
    text: |-
      Ever need to make mass changes to your archival description? Need a list of accessions for the last year? Python is a powerful way to read and manipulate your ArchivesSpace data at scale, and ArchivesSnake manages the API calls for you, so you can read, sort, and edit your titles, dates, and notes with only a few lines of code. This workshop introduces archivists to the basics of Python and teaches them how to write basic scripts to work with the ArchivesSpace API.
      This workshop is designed for archivists who have experience working with archival description, and want to learn how to work with data at scale, and explore Python as a tool to streamline or automate their workflows. Attendees will lean how to create and run Python scripts on their local computer and the basics of Python syntax. After that, they will dive right in and edit or write some code to query, reformat, and edit archival data with an ArchivesSpace instance that will be provided.
      You might not become a Python pro in one afternoon, but this workshop will give you a foundation and some basic skills and examples that will later help you explore on your own. Come dive in and learn what is possible with Python and ArchivesSpace!
      After completing this workshop, attendees will know how to:


      Create and run Python scripts


      Install packages with PIP


      Understand data types


      Use basic Python syntax, including


      If/else conditionals


      For loops


      Variables


      Understand the ArchivesSpace API


      Install and configure ArchivesSnake


      Query and edit data using the ArchivesSpace API





      Requirements:


      A laptop with the ability to install local software.


      Some comfort with the command line is helpful, but only a willingness to learn is required.


      Prior understanding of archival description and/or ArchivesSpace data will be helpful, but experience with ArchivesSpace is not required.



      About our Instructor:

      about what is going on in the country today, Americans are also more hopeful
      about solving problems. This hopefulness may account for the increased interest

      Archives Connect: Developing an Educational Outreach Initiative for Your Archive

      Archives and special collections are poised to play a more significant and instrumental role in student achievement since the implementation of the Common Core standards. With a particular emphasis on 21st Century learning skills, including the ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with peers to create high quality, scholarly work, these standards present an opportunity for archives to share their expertise with all educators and learners.
      This workshop models how participants can implement school outreach initiatives using the special collections and archives at their institutions, including how to utilize archival collections to meet Common Core Standards, create lesson plans, and engage students and teachers in history research to support a variety of academic disciplines.
      This workshop is for anyone who is interested in creating a program at their library or archive; no prior work in educational programming is required. 
      Registration includes a 120-page workshop booklet. 

      What to bring:
