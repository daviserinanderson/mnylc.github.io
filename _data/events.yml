      how you run checksums and report on them.</p> <p>Note:<br/>For this to be valuable,

      It’s a familiar story.
      Institution identifies a need. Institution applies for grant funding. Institution receives funding (or fronts the money themselves), onboards staff, works for months toward a viable outcome. Funding ends. The project sunsets, and workers find themselves on the job market once more.
      While many initiatives find their footing, this cycle is all too real in the library, archives, and museum industry. Much-heralded project outputs fall into the rear view. New services end. Workers find themselves in an increasingly contingent labor market.
      Please join us for a daylong symposium hosted by METRO Library Council (599 11th Avenue, 8th Floor) on Friday, June 14. We’ll gather to share the stories of projects that got their start with temporary sources of money, hear from grant-makers who are witness to our growing financial needs, and consider potential paths forward.

      This workshop has been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience.

      Archives and special collections are poised to play a more significant and instrumental role in student achievement since the implementation of the Common Core standards. With a particular emphasis on 21st Century learning skills, including the ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and collaborate with peers to create high quality, scholarly work, these standards present an opportunity for archives to share their expertise with all educators and learners.
      This workshop models how participants can implement school outreach initiatives using the special collections and archives at their institutions, including how to utilize archival collections to meet Common Core Standards, create lesson plans, and engage students and teachers in history research to support a variety of academic disciplines.
      This workshop is for anyone who is interested in creating a program at their library or archive; no prior work in educational programming is required. 
      Registration includes a 120-page workshop booklet. 

      What to bring:


      Notetaking materials
